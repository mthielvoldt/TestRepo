TestRepo
========

This Repo is all about understanding the processes for excluding tracked files from git.  
It is born out of the need to ignore build configuration files in an environment
where the other developers are not git experts. 

Specifically, I am using this repo to find a way to make my local repo always accept changes to specific files,
but never detect (or commit) changes that I make to the same files.
